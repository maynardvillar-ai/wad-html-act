    <h1>Villar Maynard L.</h1>
    <h2>BSIS2, Music lover, Cooking</h2>
    <h3>Listening to music, Cisco</h3>

    <b><strong>Moving from Bacolod to Pampanga was a turning point that taught me adaptation and resilience. At first, the shift was eased by family and familiarity with Tagalog, but learning Kapampangan in the neighborhood pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow. Music became my anchor, with OPM songs reflecting emotions I couldn‚Äôt put into words.</strong></b>

    <p>Academically, I‚Äôve always been committed. My decision to pursue BS Information Systems at LVCC was guided by both logic and prayer, combining my interest in technology and business with trust in God‚Äôs direction. Each step in my education feels like
        a bridge toward the future I envision.</p>

    <i>Looking back, I see how God‚Äôs grace carried me through every change whether in language, culture, or studies. I may not have all the answers yet, but I move forward with faith, a clear focus, and music that inspires me to keep growing.</i>
